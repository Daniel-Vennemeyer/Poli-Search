        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p class="lead">This is a template <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">Flask</a> app using the <a
                href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> UI framework. The app is structured based on best
            practices and experience gained through previous projects. By using a template repository you can <a
                href="https://github.com/MashSoftware/flask-bootstrap-ui/generate">generate a new repository</a> with
            the same directory structure and files to get a new project started quicker.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>This template repository uses a number of packages to provide the following features with sensible defaults.
        </p>

        <h3>Asset compression</h3>
        <p>Additional custom CSS and JS files are merged and compressed using <a
                href="https://flask-assets.readthedocs.io/en/latest">Flask Assets</a> and <a
                href="https://webassets.readthedocs.io/en/latest">Webassets</a>. This takes all <code>*.css</code> files
            in <code>app/static/src/css</code> and all <code>*.js</code> files in <code>app/static/src/js</code> and
            outputs a single compressed file to both <code>app/static/dist/css</code> and
            <code>app/static/dist/js</code> respectively.
        </p>

        <p>CSS is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)">minified</a> using
            <a href="https://github.com/zacharyvoase/cssmin">CSSMin</a> and JS is minified using <a
                href="https://github.com/tikitu/jsmin">JSMin</a>. This removes all whitespace characters, comments and
            line breaks to reduce the size of the source code, making its transmission over a network more efficient.
        </p>

        <h3>Cache busting</h3>
        <p>Merged and compressed assets also have their MD5 hash appended to the file name using <a
                href="https://flask-assets.readthedocs.io/en/latest">Flask Assets</a> and <a
                href="https://webassets.readthedocs.io/en/latest">Webassets</a>. This enables browser cache busting of
            assets when
            they have been updated by modifying their URL. The MD5 hash is appended to the file name, for example
            <code>custom-d41d8cd9.css</code> instead of a query string, to support certain older browsers and proxies
            that ignore
            the querystring in their caching behaviour.
        </p>

        <h3>Content Security Policy (CSP)</h3>
        <p>A strict default CSP is set using <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/flask-talisman">Flask Talisman</a>. This prevents loading any resources that are not in the same domain as the application, with the following exceptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>style-src</code> and <code>script-src</code> can be loaded from the Bootstrap CDN over HTTPS only. These resources also use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a> (SRI) to specify a base64-encoded sha384 cryptographic hash for additional security.</li>
            <li>To enable Bootstrap components that <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/overview/#csps-and-embedded-svgs">include embedded SVGs</a>, an additional policy of <code>img-src data: 'self'</code> has also been added.</li>
            <li>A per-request nonce value is added to the <code>style-src</code> and <code>script-src</code> policies to allow local custom CSS and JS assets to be loaded.</li>
        </ul>
